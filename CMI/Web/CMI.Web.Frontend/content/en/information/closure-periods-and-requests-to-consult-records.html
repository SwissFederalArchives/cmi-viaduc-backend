                                        Access to documents in the Federal Archives is governed by the Federal Act on Archiving (ArchA) and the Freedom of Information Act 
                                        (FoIA). ArchA sets out closure periods during which documents can only be consulted subject to authorisation. Once this period has expired, 
                                        they are available without restriction and free of charge.
                                    </b>
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The  <a href="https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19994756/index.html">Federal Act on Archiving</a> (ArchA, SR 152.1) distinguishes four types 
                                    of closure periods (see below). The majority of the documents in the Federal Archives are no longer subject to a closure period. Of the remainder, most are 
                                    subject to a closure period of 30 years under Article 9 ArchA.
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    If you wish to consult documents that are still subject to a statutory closure period, you need to sub-mit a request to the Federal Archives. If other people 
                                    (e.g. family members) wish to consult the same documents, they also need to submit a request.
                                    <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    For archived documents that were created on or after 1 July 2006, access may be obtained under ArchA and in accordance with the 
                                    <a href="https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/20022540/index.html">

                                    (FoIA, SR 152.3). In this case, the two Acts apply in parallel. The office responsible will assess re-quests according to whichever is more favourable to the applicant.

                                <h2>Requests to consult records</h2>
                                <p>
                                    To submit a request to consult records, place the dossier you want in the shopping cart and select the “Submit consultation request” option. If you wish to consult documents 
                                    relating to yourself, you must first identify yourself as a user (see
                                    <a href="/#/en/en_information/login-and-identification">
                                        Registration and identification
                                    </a>
                                    ).The SFA will forward your request to the office which decides whether the request is to be granted. You will normally receive a decision within four weeks. Requests 
                                    involving a large number of docu-ments may take longer to process.
                                </p>


                                <h2>Authorisation to consult records</h2>
                                <p>
                                    The majority of requests are approved, sometimes subject to conditions. We will notify you of authorisations to consult records in writing. You must then order 
                                    the documents you have been authorised to consult via your user account in order to view them online or in the reading room.
                                    <br/>
                                    The authorisation normally allows you to consult the documents. If you wish to publish them, you should contact the administrator responsible.
                                </p>


                                <h2>Refusal of authorisation</h2>
                                <p>
                                    You will also be notified in writing if your request is refused. You can then request an appealable ruling on this decision under ArchA or mediation under the FoIA.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Closure period under Art. 9 ArchA</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Art. 9 ArchA stipulates a closure period of 30 years. The closure period is calculated from the year in which the dossier was completed, i.e. the date of the most
                                    recent document.
                                    <br />
                                    Documents that were already publicly accessible before they were submitted to the Federal Archives remain publicly accessible thereafter.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Closure period under Art. 11 ArchA</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Documents that are catalogued by individuals’ names and contain sensitive personal data or person-ality profiles as defined in the Data Protection Act are subject to an
                                    extended closure period of 50 years. The extension ceases to apply if the person concerned has consented in writing to the docu-ments being consulted or died more than
                                    three years previously. The above is subject to Art. 12.1 and 12.2 ArchA.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    For certain categories of documents, the Federal Council may extend the closure period if they touch on matters where there is an overriding and legitimate public or private
                                    interest in preventing consultation. The documents concerned are listed in 
                                    <a href="https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19994752/index.html">

                                    If there is an overriding and legitimate public or private interest, the body submitting the documents or the Federal Archives may extend the closure period in individual cases 
                                    (usually relating to an individual dossier).
